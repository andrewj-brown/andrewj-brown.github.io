Hi there! Welcome toâ€¦ whatever this is.

### About Me

I study Computer Science and Cyber Security at the University of Queensland, with the intent to graduate at the end of 2025. I'm also a tutor & research assistant at UQ.

I enjoy systems programming, formal methods, and cyber security. When you do all three at once, you get to say stuff like "I've proven this driver never leaks secret information," which is super neat.

When I have the time to not be staring at a computer, I like to go camping, hiking, and four-wheel-driving. Occasionally I try to be good at freerunning.

#### Shortcuts

As an aside, I'm assured that the following keyboard shortcuts work on this website:
- Table of contents: **Shift + c**
- Search for an article: **Shift + s**
- Theme toggle: **Shift + t**
- Close menu: Escape (**Esc**)
